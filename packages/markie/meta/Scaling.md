## Scaling and Detail

A very interesting aspect of scalable vector graphics, sure like SVG, is that they use space-relative and/or weighted units of length. For responsive content, the latter is somewhat irrelevant if you do it right — there is no particular meaning of a pixel if the image size is 100% of the viewing space, whatever that shall be.

But in responsive images, space-relative units of length do not necessarily mean that there is no meaning of what a pixel or dot entails to the definition of a detail, only that there is no way to express that, yet.

We're going to try to sort through things to see why this dilemma exists and how novel derivatives of universally accepted phenomena could be a missing and much needed improvement for reasoning about scaling of detail in responsive content — ie scaling relative to the visual acuity of an intended viewer/viewing constraints.

### History and Background

Scaling of detail has been one of the oldest problems known to humanity. It's practical implication were vital to society, more prevailant to us in digital media, print, chartography… etc. But beyond that, scaling of detail is also intertwind with physics, math, philosophy, and even literature. It affects not only the substance of these subjects but also how we retain, relate, and continue to expand on all aspects of them not lost in details.

How that relates in this context is simple, figures, ie the collection of details meant to not be lost when scaled, have only recently started to get lost in ways that are of our own failure to design.

When chartography evolved, it went through growing phases to final give us "the scale" — the often checkered feature incorporated into a map. The map's scale is what gives us a semblance of how much time and effort can be associated with going it, where we can consider walking it based on derivatives of some feet or gates of somewhat puzzling but at least consistent conception.

Fast-forward to the printing times, we know needed all those units, which still trace to or at least derived nicely against those units for centries, until the sciences caught up with measurement footguns and started giving us metric things. Metric things are as important in significance to scientific progress as our acceptance of the fact that earth is not the center of the universe, except at least for now, and at least for where it can arguable still be very practical, the earth is kind of the center of that universe — case-in-point, time.

> Time, which obviously existed in equally significant ways before and away from planet earth, is not the only unit that revolves around it, [or at least tries to](http://us-metric.org/origin-of-the-metric-system/). And while that is true, time units serve us very well because it allows us to conceive of something that could not have be otherwise captured and compared imperically and yet its the historical superseed of its unfolding.

Human-conceivable time units work so well because it is conceptually paradoxical to make or at least be afforded time to try arguing for replacing them, at least until a day is not some round fraction of it in that your clock can have symmetry and scale to give you details necessary enough to want it affixed to your person.

Human-conceivable distance, in comparision, not so fortuned, at least for most humans, where you won't usually find affixed to them a ruler, but if you do, it is often one of many forms, and likely the only form which would be of any use for said person, based on their day-to-day. But still, most of us often find ourselves looking for "a ruler" and for those who don't, it is unlikely or at least hopefully still not affixed.

The argument to be made here is that, when conidering units for various dimensions, we conceive of them in relative scale, and where the reference is predictable, and where it is either less questionable or much harder to become, society defaults more easily towards universality for practicality.

## Working Premise

We can try to address scaling matters in pixels, points, microns... etc., when we are simply talking about the absolute length rendered by the viewing system. Where a pixel on screen is considered the physically addressable unit, and the number of them relative to a constant of a physical length is considered resolution. However, those two concepts, addressability and resolution, are abscent of any mechanics of actual viewer appreciation, ie retaining and relating detail.

What we need instead is means to not only specify scale of responsive details in their ratios, but also in both system and observer units.

## Discussion

Much like color, detail, transcends beyond mere system capabilities, and must also factor in the both the dynamics of viewers and viewing conditions.

If we want to preserve detail when scaling, we must do so with devices that align the presentation of matter with the specific dynamics of its viewing.

Compared to color however, we can arguably consider a viewer to be viewing matter of detail where they can normally exhibit much more appreciation and control on the appropriate viewing conditions, or the lack of it. And this would be due to the more obvious nature of failure, where inadequate scaling for a viewer in most cases becomes obvious by the matter, or at least by proxy of a more familiar detail to be expected.

> **Example**: noting excessive scaling because of consistent blurrying across bitmaps, compared to excessive contrast burning out subtle detail being more readily written down to be preference or appeal.

In all cases, today's viewers are likely more aware of and correct for over- and under-compensation by having just the right amount of accessible and relatable user-facing controls, why pinch scaling has been so successful.

Responsive matter suffers deeply in this context, and that is because comes with no or at least arbitrary and mystical dynamics for its limits. So when a user expects a vector image to have infinite detail, why they are not able to zoom in on the same detail between two devices or two versions of the same file… in all likelyhood, one of the most underappreciated matters of responsive matter.

The counterpart to this is when they zoom in and find detail scaling where not expected, largely where the function of length applies to effect, not detail. So when a user expects an outline to be discrete for symbolic or annotation effect, why they find such detail lost or exaggerated on devices of different constraints, and the often unpredictable manifestations compound with less pronounce or relatable scaling controls.
